# ISU Journal
This is my work log journal for my final assignment. I will add my research and knowledge for this project in this repo.

a) Python web scraping using beautiful soup

b) This project is about learning how to webscrape on python with the help of the python requests library and beautiful soup package. I will webscrape 2 different static websites. One with the help of a guide, and one I'll be doing on my own. 

c) I want to have better html comprehension and have one script done for one static website. 

d) I will need to use libraries from python such as beautiful soup and python's requests library.
