# ISU Journal
This is my work log journal for my final assignment. I will add my research and knowledge for this project in this repo.

a) AI WEB SCRAPER

b) This project is about teaching an ai how to webscrape a given amount of websites using elements in python. For example, I will giev the AI a range of websites like walmart.ca, h&m.ca, and winners.ca and the AI will retrieve information from these websites about an inputted clothing. Ei: input is "black top", so AI will retrieve black tops from these sites and offer the cheapest deal.

c) I want to have an AI that can at least webscrape one given website.

d) I will need to use libraries from python such as beautiful soup, and a library that I still have not researched on for creating/generating an AI.
